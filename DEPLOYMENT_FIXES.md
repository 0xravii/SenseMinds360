# Deployment Error Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve production deployment errors.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. API Fetch Failures (`TypeError: Failed to fetch`)

**Problem:** API calls were failing with `Failed to fetch from /ml/current`, `Failed to fetch ML predictions`, and `Error fetching system metrics`.

**Root Cause:** The application was trying to make direct API calls to external URLs from the browser in production, which is blocked by CORS and network policies.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `src/services/api/index.ts` to use relative paths (`/api`) in production
- Configured Vercel proxy in `vercel.json` to route `/api/*` requests to the external API
- Added additional proxy routes for `/metrics`, `/health`, and `/ready` endpoints

### 2. WebSocket Mixed Content Warnings

**Problem:** WebSocket connections were attempting to connect to insecure `ws://` endpoints over HTTPS, causing mixed content warnings.

**Root Cause:** The realtime service was hardcoded to use `http://` WebSocket URLs.

**Solution:**
- Updated `src/services/realtime/index.ts` to use secure WebSocket (`wss://`) in production
- Added environment-based URL selection for development vs production

### 3. Manifest.json 401 Error

**Problem:** The PWA manifest was returning a 401 error.

**Solution:**
- Added proper headers configuration in `vercel.json` for `manifest.json`
- Ensured proper caching and security headers

## Files Modified

1. **src/services/api/index.ts**
   - Changed `API_BASE_URL` to use `/api` in production
   - Updated `getSystemMetrics` to use proxy route in production

2. **src/services/realtime/index.ts**
   - Updated WebSocket URL to use `wss://` in production
   - Added environment-based URL selection

3. **vercel.json**
   - Added proxy rewrites for `/api/*`, `/metrics`, `/health`, `/ready`
   - Configured proper headers for manifest.json and security

4. **DEPLOY.md**
   - Updated environment variables documentation
   - Added production deployment notes

## Environment Variables for Production

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_REALTIME_WS_URL=wss://34.121.143.178:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MOCK_MODE=false
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Deployment Status

✅ API fetch errors resolved  
✅ WebSocket mixed content warnings fixed  
✅ Manifest.json configuration updated  
✅ Production build successful  
✅ Vercel configuration optimized  

The application is now ready for production deployment to Vercel with all errors resolved.
